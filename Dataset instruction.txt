1. youtube_videos (200)

Contains the 200 original YouTube video files in .mp4 format.
These are the raw videos before preprocessing.

2. npy_segments_videosource

Contains .npy files where each file corresponds to a video segment represented as 320 frames.
Segments are extracted after frame division and include both violence labels and video source information.
This set is larger than the unimodal version because segmentation with video source produces more clips.

3. npy_segments_unimodal

Contains .npy files where each segment is represented as 320 frames.
Labels are violence only (binary classification: violent vs. non-violent).
This is the standard unimodal dataset used for baseline experiments.
